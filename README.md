## 🛡️ PlaySafe AI - Online Gambling Addiction: Early Detection & Prevention

### 🚨 Problem Statement
Gambling addiction impacts millions worldwide, causing financial, emotional, and social distress. Early detection is limited, and individuals often fail to seek intervention until it's too late. Young children are also increasingly vulnerable to online gambling, lacking proper safeguards.

🔹 **Shocking Stats:**
- Gambling has the **highest suicide rate** among addictions. Nearly **40%** of individuals with gambling disorders consider suicide.
- **18% of online gamblers** are in gambling debt (~3.3 million people), with an average debt of **£10,000**.
- A survey found that **0.7% of 11 to 17-year-olds** are problem gamblers, **1.5% are at risk**, and **23% are non-problem gamblers**.
